# How to Play

To play the game, simply run the ConnectFour class as described above. The game will prompt the first player to enter their name, and then the second player to enter their name. Players will then take turns placing tokens on the board by entering the column number they wish to place their token in.

For example, if a player wishes to place their token in the third column, they would enter 3 at the prompt.

The game will continue until one player connects four tokens in a row, column, or diagonal, or until the board is full and no player has won.
